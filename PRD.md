# Circuit Flow

## 🎯 Product Vision
A visually stunning web application that transforms documentation into an interactive circuit board experience, where ideas flow as electrical pulses through golden traces on a dark PCB interface.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional documentation viewers are static and uninspiring. Users need an engaging way to interact with technical documentation (PRD, TRD) that matches the energy and innovation of modern development workflows.

## 🎯 Goals
- Create an immersive circuit board visualization for document browsing
- Implement animated electrical pulse effects along circuit traces
- Enable interactive chip elements that reveal content on hover
- Deliver smooth SVG path animations using CSS
- Support document download interactions via click mechanics

## 🚫 Non-Goals
- 3D rendering or WebGL implementation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Document editing capabilities
- User authentication system
- Alternative visual themes

## 👥 Target Users
- Developers exploring project documentation
- Technical leads reviewing product specifications
- Stakeholders viewing architectural designs
- Users who appreciate unique visual interfaces

## 🧩 Core Features
- Virtual cable input interaction to trigger animations
- SVG circuit board with golden trace paths
- CSS stroke-dasharray pulse animations along circuit lines
- Five interactive microchip rectangles (PRD.md, TRD.md, etc.)
- Thermal vision hover effects (red/orange glow)
- Binary code particle emission on hover
- Click-to-cool-down download interaction
- Central CPU chip visualization for navigation
- Rhythmic pulsing animations for activated chips

## ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
- Animation frame rate of 60fps for smooth pulse effects
- Page load time under 2 seconds on standard broadband
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet screens
- Accessibility support for keyboard navigation
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## 📊 Success Metrics
- Average time spent on page exceeds 30 seconds
- Document download completion rate above 70%
- Animation smoothness rated 4+ stars in user feedback
- Return visitor rate above 25%

## 📌 Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers supporting CSS animations
- Users view on devices with minimum 1920x1080 resolution
- Documents are pre-generated and hosted as static files
- JavaScript is enabled in user browsers
- Network latency is under 100ms for optimal animation timing
